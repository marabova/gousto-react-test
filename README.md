## Non-Functional Requirements

- UI should be built with React, but you are allowed to use additional other libraries if needed

- Use your preferred CSS solution/library. Use your imagination, but do not spend to much time for css
- The application should be responsive (the application can be used on mobile)
- The code should include `test`
- The code should be production ready (no refactoring need)

## Help us to understand your solution

- In order to understand better you solution we would like to see the following sections in a Readme:
  - `How to use`: details about how to use your solution(if anything different from what we added)
  - `Application structure`: explain the architecture - feel free to change the base structure from this test
  - `A list of missing functional requirements`: if any, and explain why you didn't complete them
  - `Possible improvements/ functionality`: anything that you wished you could've added if you had more time
